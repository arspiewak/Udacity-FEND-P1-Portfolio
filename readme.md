# FEND-P1-Portfolio  Project for Intro to HTML & CSS and Front-End Nanodegree

Odd notes:
- The first phase of this project is matching the assigned mockup. I have saved that
  state of my project with branch name "mockup". I then personalized and "responsive-ized" 
  the page.
- The images used in the mockup phase were obtained by exporting JPG images from the 
  design PDF provided by the instructors. Used courtesy of Udacity.
